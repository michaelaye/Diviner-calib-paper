This paper describes the methods to calbrate LRO's Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment. 
Like many radiometers, Diviner is sensitive to instrument temperature changes along the orbit of LRO.
Regularly executed calibration blocks include instrument pointings to space and towards internal blackbodies at a known temperature.
Data from these blocks serve to determine current offsets and current DN to radiance conversion value.
A ground calibration campaign served to determine conversion tables over temperature.
